DivAura is a multilingual, AI- and IoT-powered web application designed to improve crowd management and devotee experience at major pilgrimage sites such as Somnath, Dwarka, Ambaji, and 
Pavagadh. 
The system integrates virtual queuing, smart ticketing, real-time crowd monitoring, and AI-based prediction models to ensure safer, smoother, and more organized movement of devotees.

By combining machine learning, sensor-based monitoring, and web technologies, DivAura forecasts crowd size and waiting times, detects potential risks such as falls or overcrowding, and 
provides instant alerts to administrators. IoT devices like QR scanners, CO₂ and heat sensors, cameras, and SOS buttons enable real-time environmental and safety monitoring.

The platform offers dedicated support for elderly and differently-abled devotees while helping authorities optimize parking, staffing, and traffic flow. 
Overall, DivAura transforms traditional manual crowd management into a smart, scalable, and data-driven system that enhances safety, efficiency, and the spiritual experience of pilgrims.
